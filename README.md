# Europe's Language Families
## Justin Peter, Donghyun Jeon, Daniel Felbah

For this project, we performed a combination of data analysis, visualization, and models based on classification and clustering.

Our data was based on countries and continents and we ended up filtering our data to Europe.

With that data, we made algorithmic clusters by placing categories in terms of the region they're located, their language family, and their tourism index.

After that, we ended up using KMeans Time Series clustering from TSLearn to place each country into one of four clusters.

The reason we did this is based on the fact that the media tends to talk more about Romance countries, such as Italy, Spain, and France in terms of the cases and deaths.

However, there's much to uncover regarding the Slavic and Germanic countries, so we use the analysis to show the differences.

We compared all the clusters using scatterplots and confusion matrices for each column that displays information such as the number of cases, deaths, tests, etc.
